        <h1>A Story From A Notebook</h1>

        <p>Its summer time, but close to fall.  The sun is going down and the air is cool, but its still plenty warm outside.</p>

        <p>I'm not cold at all.  The sun is hanging in the western sky and will be gone in the next hour or so.</p>

        <p>The light is a cool blue and pink, sofly illuminating the neighborhood.</p>

        <p>The only thing I can smell is the tree that I'm sitting in.</p>

        <p>I'm positioned above my house waiting to see my dad's black Jeep Wrangler turn on to my block</p>

        <p>I'm waiting in this tree because I want my dad to see how high I can climb.</p>

        <p id="odd">I climb this tree every day.</p>

        <p>I'm the best climber out of all the nieghborhood kids.</p>
